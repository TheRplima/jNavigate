jQuery Ajax Navigation
===

jNavigate is a powerful jQuery plugin that enables you to build dynamic content
areas with Ajax simply and quickly. Turn hyperlinks into triggers that load page
content dynamically with a loading overlay and reduce the load on your web 
server while enhancing the user experience.

Check out the [official site](http://jnavigate.com/docs) for the option 
reference and usage instructions.
